# Jupyter Notebook

## Jupyter in Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks through the Jupyter extension. To use Jupyter in VS Code:
1. Install the Jupyter extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook".
3. You can now write and execute Jupyter cells within VS Code.


### Jupyter Kernel in VS Code
A Jupyter kernel is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a Jupyter notebook. In VS Code, you can select the kernel you want to use for a Jupyter notebook by clicking on the kernel name in the top right corner of the notebook.

## Jupyter in Google Colab
Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google. To use Jupyter in Google Colab:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Create a new notebook or upload an existing one.
4. You can write and execute code cells, and Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs.

## Jupyter in Github
GitHub supports rendering Jupyter notebooks directly in the browser. To use Jupyter in GitHub:
1. Push your Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to a GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the notebook file in your repository.
3. GitHub will render the notebook, allowing you to view the code and outputs.

## Setup Kernel in Jupyter Notebook

### Install Python
1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python on your system.
3. Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during the installation process.

### Create a Virtual Environment in VS Code
1. Open VS Code and navigate to the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
2. Type `Python: Create Environment` and select it.
3. Choose `Venv` as the environment type.
4. Select the Python interpreter you installed earlier.
5. VS Code will create a virtual environment and activate it.
6. Install Jupyter in the virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```sh
   pip install jupyter
   ```
7. You can now create and run Jupyter notebooks using the virtual environment.
